This is the first laboratory's repository. Its objective is to provide an environment for students to practice their skills in the Data Structure and Algorithms (#EDA) course and familiarize them with the structure in Python, the VS Code IDE, and the GIT/GitHub technologies.

This repository is part of the data structure and algorithms (#EDA) teaching framework at Universidad de los Andes. The repository was developed by faculty professors and staff in the Department of Systems and Computer Engineer (#DISC) and uses the Non-Object-Oriented Python paradigm.

<!-- STRUCTURE -->

### Structure

This laboratory repository has four main parts:

1. [DataStructures](./DataStructures) Folder with the data structures case for students documentation. [Data Structures Documentation][data-struc-url].
1. [App](./App) Folder with the Model-View-Controller (MVC) Python scripts. In here the students implement their code to complete the laboratory instructions.
1. [Data](./Data) Folder with CSV data files to load into the application. In here the students add the data files provided by the course staff to complete the laboratory.
1. [Docs](./Docs) Folder with the report, data table and other documentation. In here the students add their project report, data tables and other files to complement their code implementation.
